[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/jhaagsma/ee_npc/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/jhaagsma/ee_npc/?branch=master)

*Caveat: I developed this really quickly to get it going, and am now regretting that, as it's very disorganized; I will slowly be refactoring it to make it easier to use.

----

1) DOWNLOAD PHP FOR WINDOWS: https://windows.php.net/download/
2) Probably get the newest version, definitely PHP 7+
3) Extract the zip to C:\php

5) Go to C:\php\ext and COPY php_curl.dll; PASTE it into C:\php
6) OPEN php.ini-development in an editor (notepad)
7) Find the line: ;extension=php_curl.dll and remove the leading semi-colon / Change it to: extension=php_curl.dll
8) If that line doesn't exist, add it after [curl]
9) Save the changed file as C:\php\php.ini
10 DOWNLOAD the **x86 version** of the MS VC package: http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679

To Contribute!
----

Fork the project, using the fork button.

Then clone it locally, make changes, and push them to github.

When you're happy with them, create a pull request, and I'll merge in your changes after reviewing them. It would be better to make smaller changes at a time, so I can digest them ;-)
